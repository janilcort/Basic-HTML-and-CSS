<h3>"The Quiet Hour"</h3>
<p>
When twilight falls on fields of gold,<br>And stories soften, sweetly told,<br>
<br>The hush of dusk, a velvet sound,<br>Wraps weary hearts the world around.<br><br>
A single star begins to gleam,<br>Like hope within a half-lost dream,
<br>And night, with gentle, silent art,
<br>Restitches seams of every heart.
